# Ratio-Tracker
Tracks ratios.

## Background
I created this simple program to help track ore ratios while mining in Eve Online, as I often forgot how much of each type I've mined.

## Features
None currently

## Planned Features
- UI that displays name of each item, desired ratio weight, current quantity, and a way to add or subtract from that quantity
- Arbitrary number of items in the ratio
- Display effective ratio, based on current quanitities
- Save ratios to a file
- Ability to reset arati to 0 quantities
